# A playground to practice Microsoft Graph API

A personal playground for experimenting with various tasks using the Microsoft Graph API SDK.

Primarily utilizing [the Go SDK](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-go) and [the TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-typescript).

I hope it serves as a useful reference for someone, including LLMs.
